    <p>A <strong>laptop </strong>(also <strong> laptop computer</strong>), is a small, portable personal computer (PC)
        with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the
        upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened
        up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its
        name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap when being used. Although originally there
        was a distinction between laptops and notebooks (the former being bigger and heavier than the latter), as of
        2014, there is often no longer any difference. Today, laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such
        as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer
        use.

        Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer, including the display
        screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, sometimes an optical disc drive, pointing devices (such
        as a touchpad or trackpad), with an operating system, a processor and memory into a single unit. Most modern
        laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while many also have touchscreens. Laptops can be
        powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter. Hardware
        specifications, such as the processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types,
        makes, models and price points.

        Design elements, form factor and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on intended
        use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in construction or military
        applications, as well as low production cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC)
        organization, which incorporate features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most
        laptop computers. Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to
        be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or
        for traveling sales representatives. As the portable computers evolved into the modern laptop, they became
        widely used for a variety of purposes.[2]</p>

    <h2>Terminology_variants</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably to describe a portable computer in English, although in
        some parts of the world one or the other may be preferred. There is some question as to the original etymology
        and specificity of either term—the term laptop appears to have been coined in the early 1980s to describe a
        mobile computer which could be used on one's lap, and to distinguish these devices from earlier, much heavier,
        portable computers (informally called "luggables"). The term "notebook" appears to have gained currency somewhat
        later as manufacturers started producing even smaller portable devices, further reducing their weight and size
        and incorporating a display roughly the size of A4 paper; these were marketed as notebooks to distinguish them
        from bulkier laptops.[3] Regardless of the etymology, by the late 1990s and towards the 2000s, the terms were
        interchangeable.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_laptops"> History of laptops</a></p>
    <p>As the personal computer (PC) became feasible in 1971, the idea of a portable personal computer soon followed. A
        "personal, portable information manipulator" was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968,[4] and described in
        his 1972 paper as the "Dynabook".[5] The IBM Special Computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP) was demonstrated in
        1973. This prototype was based on the IBM PALM processor.[6] The IBM 5100, the first commercially available
        portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based on the SCAMP prototype.[7]

        As 8-bit CPU machines became widely accepted, the number of portables increased rapidly. The first "laptop-sized
        notebook computer" was the Epson HX-20,[8][9] invented (patented) by Suwa Seikosha's Yukio Yokozawa in July
        1980,[10] introduced at the COMDEX computer show in Las Vegas by Japanese company Seiko Epson in 1981,[11][9]
        and released in July 1982.[9][12] It had an LCD screen, a rechargeable battery, and a calculator-size printer,
        in a 1.6 kg (3.5 lb) chassis, the size of an A4 notebook.[9] It was described as a "laptop" and "notebook"
        computer in its patent.[10]

        The portable micro computer Portal of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in September 1980
        at the Sicob show in Paris. It was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and
        developments department of R2E Micral at the request of company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. It
        was based on an Intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It was equipped with a central 64 KB RAM, a
        keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk
        : capacity = 140,000 characters, of a thermal printer : speed = 28 characters / second, an asynchronous channel,
        a synchronous channel, a 220 V power supply. It weighed 12 kg and its dimensions were 45 x 45 x 15 cm. It
        provided total mobility. Its operating system was the aptly named Prologue.


        A Siemens PCD-3Psx laptop, released in 1989
        The Osborne 1, released in 1981, was a luggable computer that used the Zilog Z80 and weighed 24.5 pounds (11.1
        kg).[13] It had no battery, a 5 in (13 cm) cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, and dual 5.25 in (13.3 cm)
        single-density floppy drives. Both Tandy/RadioShack and Hewlett Packard (HP) also produced portable computers of
        varying designs during this period.[14][15] The first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early
        1980s. The Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981–82, but was not marketed internationally until
        1984–85. The US$8,150 (US$21,590 today) GRiD Compass 1101, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the
        military, among others. The Sharp PC-5000,[16] Ampere[17] and Gavilan SC released in 1983. The Gavilan SC was
        described as a "laptop" by its manufacturer,[18] while the Ampere had a modern clamshell design.[17][19] The
        Toshiba T1100 won acceptance not only among PC experts but the mass market as a way to have PC portability.[20]

        From 1983 onward, several new input techniques were developed and included in laptops, including the touchpad
        (Gavilan SC, 1983), the pointing stick (IBM ThinkPad 700, 1992), and handwriting recognition (Linus
        Write-Top,[21] 1987). Some CPUs, such as the 1990 Intel i386SL, were designed to use minimum power to increase
        battery life of portable computers and were supported by dynamic power management features such as Intel
        SpeedStep and AMD PowerNow! in some designs.

        Displays reached 640x480 (VGA) resolution by 1988 (Compaq SLT/286), and color screens started becoming a common
        upgrade in 1991, with increases in resolution and screen size occurring frequently until the introduction of 17"
        screen laptops in 2003. Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5"
        drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5" and smaller drives
        around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives. Optical storage,
        read-only CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and Blu-ray players, became
        common in laptops early in the 2000s.</p>
